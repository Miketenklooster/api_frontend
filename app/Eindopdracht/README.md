# Eindopdracht Movie Radar

## Frontend Framework:

Why UIkit? The purpose of this optional part was to challenge myself with new Frontend Frameworks. Especially UIkit exceeded my expectations, Thats why I decided to do my final project with it.
The reason it exceeded my expectations was that it is well documented and easy to understand.


## Target Audience:

I wanted to make my site usable by as many people as possible, to do that I did some research to what almost all people liked. From my results I concluded that movies and series are really popular. This made me choose to use the OMDB API from http://www.omdbapi.com/. 

This API has lot of data which made it possible for me to reach an even larger audience, because this way I was able to get a lot genre's. This way no matter what taste movie or series you have, you can use the site to get the information you want.
